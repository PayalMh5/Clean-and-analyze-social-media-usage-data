# Clean and analyze social media usage data with Python

Project scenario

You're a data analyst at a marketing firm that promotes brands on social media. Your team wants you to use Python to extract tweets based on specific categories (health, family, food, etc.), clean and analyze the data, and create visualizations. They will use your analysis to help clients improve their social media performance. This insight will allow the firm to deliver tweets on time and within budget, leading to faster results.
